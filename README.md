# NFL_prospects_production_scores


# In these files below I have written code which can rank different college prospects at their respective positions to see which ones are the most NFL ready.

# To run the code, the user must first select "1" to add a new prospect. After doing so the program will ask for some stats of the prospect in question, and after filling out the stats it gives a place to input the prospects name. After doing so with all of your candidates you can see the rankings of the prospects by clicking the "2" button and the program will output all of the candidates in descending order from the best prospect to the worst. 

# The scale which I used to measure talent based score is as follows: 

# 75 - 100 -------> Generational talent
# 60 - 75 --------> Elite/Good Starter
# 50 - 60 --------> Borderline Starter/ Backup 
# 0 - 50 ---------> Career Backup
